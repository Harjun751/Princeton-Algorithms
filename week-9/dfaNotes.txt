Why the DFA simulates the previous term:
e.g. 
Pattern: ABABAC

If we reach the 5th state, we know some things about the text.
Firstly, the text we have processed is ABABA. We are expeting a C to finish the state.

If it's not a C, how do we know where to go in the DFA? We "Simulate"
a back-up. If we back up now, the text will be "BABA", as we remove the first
letter. Knowing BABA, we can use this text to find out which state this 
process will end up at without truly backing up.

So: simulation of next term prevents back up and is a natural continuation
of the input stream
